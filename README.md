## üòΩ „Ä¢ Basic Knowledge

Animal Jam Classic, formerly known as Animal Jam, is a massively multiplayer online game that is developed by WildWorks and recommended for kids up to the age of 12. It was launched in 2010, in collaboration with the National Geographic Society. As of late 2020, there were 3.3 million monthly active users and a lifetime total of 130 million registered players in 200 countries across both Animal Jam Classic and Animal Jam.

In this game the trading is a very important fact because there are high value items, some can cost more than $100\
this caused the game to be filled with scammers, but the straw that spilled the spleen was when in November 2020 the game database was leaked\
This attracted crackers who wanted to get money by logging into these accounts and selling the most worthwhile items.\
This motivated certain "hackers" to create malware to steal the information of game users, they did this in the following way\

What these "hackers" did was create a "config" in openbullet (popular program used for account cracking)\
and add a "stealer" which is a python file compiled into an .exe\

when a person use that config they received all their information (browsers cookies/password, discord tokens, etc),\
 but also injected into the animal jam desktop application a simple script that was added to the "app.asar" file\
